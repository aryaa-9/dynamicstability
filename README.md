# dynamicstability

This project focuses on finding the equilibrium points of a system of differential equations.  
Further, it plots a given (energy function for the damped harmonic oscillator case) function to help determine if it is a strict Lyapunov function.  
Finally, it determines the stability of the dynamical system near all the found equilibrium points.  

Output (of Function 3) - 

The Equilibrium point(s):  
V(0.2928932188, -0.2071067812) =  3.9857660327420693e-07  
V(1.7071067812, 1.2071067812) =  612.5312496593465  
V(0.0, 0.0) =  0.0
