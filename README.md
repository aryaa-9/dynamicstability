# dynamicstability

This project focuses on finding the equilibrium points of a system of differential equations.  
Further, it plots a given (energy function for the damped harmonic oscillator case) function and determines if it is a strict lyapunov function.  
Finally, it determines the stability of the dynamical system near all the found equilibrium points.
